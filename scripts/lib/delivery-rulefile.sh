# Shared "rule-file" delivery behavior.
#
# Some agent types integrate by writing a small markdown rules file that tells
# the agent to poll the agmsg inbox after each tool call (gemini, antigravity,
# opencode). Their per-type plug (scripts/drivers/types/<name>/_delivery.sh) is then a one-line
# delegation to rulefile_apply.
#
# Runs in delivery.sh's sourced context: resolve_hooks_file and SKILL_DIR are
# provided by the caller (delivery.sh sources this lib and the type plug).
rulefile_apply() {
  local type="$1" project="$2" mode="$3"
  # Refuse before any write: an empty SKILL_DIR would render broken guidance
  # paths into the rule file, and the rm -f below removes the existing rule
  # file first -- an unreadable value must never be treated as "nothing to
  # preserve" (#1234 review).
  [ -n "${SKILL_DIR:-}" ] || { echo "rulefile_apply ($type): SKILL_DIR is not set; refusing rather than writing a broken rule file" >&2; return 1; }

# agmsg Integration Rule

## PostToolUse
After each tool call, automatically check the agmsg inbox for unread messages.
- Command: '$SKILL_DIR/scripts/check-inbox.sh' '$type' '$project'

## Terminal/pane self-awareness
Asked about your own terminal, pane, or driver — or before using arrange/peek/poke
— run '$SKILL_DIR/scripts/where.sh' first and answer from its terminal=/capabilities=
fields. Never guess from environment variables or a grep/ps command; a driver
that IS present can be wrongly reported absent that way. Per-driver detail:
'$SKILL_DIR/scripts/drivers/terminals/<terminal>/README.md' (terminal= names which).

## Teammates: placement, status, and reaching them
Placement and status for a teammate: '$SKILL_DIR/scripts/team.sh' <team> — never a
stale memory of their last known pane. Act on one with '$SKILL_DIR/scripts/peek.sh'
/ 'poke.sh' / 'arrange.sh' <team> <name> directly, not a guess: its exit code
says whether it worked and, if not, why.
