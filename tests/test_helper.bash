# #1095: a test that exercises join.sh/actas-claim.sh/spawn.sh/watch.sh/
# session-start.sh/check-inbox.sh (or the two libraries under them) is, as far
# as the self-naming primitive can tell, a seat acting -- so it names the pane
# it is running in, with its own fixture team/agent. On a real machine that is
# the developer's own terminal, inherited because bats runs inside it. This is
# TOP-LEVEL, not inside setup_test_env(): `load test_helper` runs it before
# ANY test's own setup(), so it reaches every file that loads this one,
# including one (test_install.bats) whose own setup() never calls
# setup_test_env. A file that deliberately exercises the switch itself
# (test_self_name.bats, test_self_rename.bats) unsets this right after
# loading -- that is a local, visible override, not a gap in this default.
# Hard safety boundary: a test that opts back into self-naming must first install
# a fake terminal. Clear every ambient terminal marker while this helper loads,
# before any suite-level setup or test body can unset AGMSG_SELF_NAME. Tests that
# deliberately model a real terminal restore these variables explicitly, using
# a fake driver or a documented fixture socket.

# Fail the test when <cmd> SUCCEEDS.

# `! cmd` cannot do this. POSIX errexit exempts a negated command, on every
# bash, so `! grep -q needle file` is silent when the needle IS there -- the
# one outcome it was written to catch. Measured on 3.2.57 and 5.3.15: both
# report `ok` (#670).
#
# Deliberately not `run cmd` + `[ "$status" -ne 0 ]`, which also works: `run`
# overwrites `$output` and `$status`, so converting an absence check that way
# silently breaks any assertion after it that still reads `$output`. That is a
# real bug, not a hypothetical -- it happened twice in #697 -- and 48 sites is
# too many to hand that to.
#
# Says what failed, because a bare `false` leaves the reader to work out which
# of several absence checks was the one that fired.

# A live process whose command line contains <path>, and nothing else.

# The kill paths in session-end.sh / session-start.sh only signal a pid whose
# cmdline still looks like this install's watch.sh -- a deliberate defence
# against pid recycling. Fixtures used a bare `sleep`, whose cmdline does not
# match, so the kill never fired and the assertion checking for it was `!
# kill -0 ...`, which is silent on every bash. The tests passed for years
# without once exercising the branch they are named after (#670).
#
# It runs a script that sleeps; it does NOT exec, which would drop the argument
# from the command line, and it does NOT start the real watcher -- a live
# watcher inside a test is how a suite grows processes that outlive it.
# Sets DECOY_PID rather than printing it: `pid="$(spawn_...)"` runs the `&` in
# a command substitution's subshell, and the child dies with that subshell. The
# first version did exactly that, and the tests using it went green because the
# decoy was already gone -- not because anything had killed it. Returning
# through a variable keeps the process a child of the test.
# The same reader the product uses to decide whether a pid is one of ours, so
# a fixture's precondition is checked the way session-end.sh checks it rather

# Sends <count> messages of ~<bodylen> bytes each from <from> to <to> on
# <team>, via storage_send directly rather than send.sh's own CLI (#777
# argv-length regressions in inbox.sh/check-inbox.sh/watch.sh/watch-once.sh).
#
# A plain bash FUNCTION CALL, not a subprocess: `storage_send "$team" ...
# "$body"` hands the body to sqlite3 through the same escaped-argv path
# production code uses for a single INSERT (which is not itself in scope --
# no test here builds a body anywhere near that ceiling), but building the
# backlog this way never has to exec anything with the WHOLE backlog as one
# argument, which is exactly the shape production code used to get wrong
# on read. Bodies are tagged "$label-$i-<pad>" so a caller can assert both
# ends of the run (index 0 and count-1) are actually present in what the
# script under test displayed, not just that its exit status was 0.
# 1.3.1 CI speedup: a 100-message backlog through the loop below used to
# spawn one sqlite3 process PER MESSAGE (storage_send's own -bail invocation),
# which is what made the two tests that build a real argv-ceiling-sized
# backlog the two slowest in this file. Verified before switching: a 3-message
# batch built the old way (storage_send in a loop, one sqlite3 call each) and
# the new way (one sqlite3 call for all 3) were compared row-for-row across
# both `messages` and `events` -- same team/from/to/body fields, same rowid
# sequencing, same events.legacy_id -> messages.rowid linkage. Only
# created_at differs, because the batched form finishes fast enough that
# _sqlite_now's second-granularity clock barely advances between messages --
# expected, not a correctness difference (each message's timestamp is still
# a real, distinct call to the same clock function). Only takes this path
# when the driver is sqlite (the only one an argv-ceiling concern applies to,
# and the one whose private functions this depends on); any other driver
# keeps the one-call-per-message loop unchanged.
