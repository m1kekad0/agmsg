# --- Bounded condition waits -------------------------------------------------
#
# Wait for a condition to become true, polling, instead of sleeping a fixed
# interval and hoping. A fixed `sleep 1` after launching a watcher is wrong in
# both directions at once: it costs a whole second when the watcher was ready in
# 40ms, and it still flakes on a loaded runner where the watcher needs 1.2s.
# Polling is both faster and steadier, which is why the pattern already existed
# ad hoc in test_watch.bats, test_install.bats and test_codex_bridge_launcher.bats
# before it was hoisted here.
#
# Each returns non-zero on timeout, so a caller can fail with its own message or
# clean up a background process first. The 10s ceiling is far above any real
# local transition and well under the per-job CI timeout.
#

# asserts something does NOT happen cannot poll for it — see the comment at the
# remaining fixed sleeps in test_delivery.bats.
